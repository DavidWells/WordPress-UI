WordPress-UI
=====================

WordPress UI built in React.

Work in progress. Pull requests welcome.

It would seem like many of the UI components currently in WordPress core are antiquated.

For example, the settings form is an `table` instead of `div` based.

I'm strategizing an alternative, it would seem that all WordPress core CSS classes/styles would need to be reimplemented and would break if core changes.
